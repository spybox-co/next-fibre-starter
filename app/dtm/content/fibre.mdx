### If you see THIS
it means that it works!

## 2x Grid for video
A unique application of the 2x Grid has been derived for the standard 1920x1080 
video format. Due to these fixed dimensions and aspect ratio, there 
is a fundamental mini unit of 7.5px which allows for perfectly even divisions 
of the grid at 30px intervals.

The 8 column structure pictured below will be sufficient for most layouts. 
If required, the canvas can be futher subdivided into 16 columns. 
It is recommended to have all elements ‘snap to grid’ with 30px 
increments in order to ensure proper alignments within the overall layout.
